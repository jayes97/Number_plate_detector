Hello Sir/Mam,

sorry for the delayed submition.

I had got multiple assignments at same time so it took long...
model training and testing was done completely on first day

Reasons for delay :- 
	1. Vscode env issue with anaconda (scikit-learn---> sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder ----> No such module found )... Solved and model runs as expected on local server
	2. Unable to host on heroku because slug size exceeded 500mb (mine was 550mb).. Solved by changing Tensorflow 2.6.0 ----> Tensorflow-cpu 2.6.0
	3. Unable to run on heroku because heroku install python 3.9 while my project contains OpenCv and which is compatible with python 3.7... 
		Not solved. didn't got solution to install python 3.7 instead if 3.9 		

The projects run very well on local server::

Please check the project and let me know if it was satisfactory or Not....
Thank you for giving a chance.
